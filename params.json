{"name":"Panasonic-rec","tagline":"Recovery programs for MEIHDFS-V2.0 used by Panasonic DVR-Recorders","body":"There seem to be at least 2 types of Filesystems in use on Panasonic DVR recorders:\r\nThe oder ones use UDF, the newer ones seem to have a custom file system called\r\nMEIHDFS-V2.0. So if the harddisk in such a DVR-Recorder dies, it is\r\ndifficult to recover data from it, because the filesystem is entirely\r\nundocumented and proprietary.\r\nBut there may be hope! This tool is an attempt to parse the filesystem\r\nstructures and extract the files.\r\n\r\nI made 2 different tools, one is for UDF variant and one for MEIHDFS2.\r\n\r\n# UDF\r\n\r\nFor further information on how to use it, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/leecher1337/panasonic-rec/blob/master/udf/README.txt) file. \r\n\r\nFor the impatient ones, assuming you have a disk image image.dd and a recovery destination directory f:\\dump, just do:\r\n\r\n`udf_dump image.dd f:\\dump`\r\n\r\nAfter successful extraction, you can do this to extract the programs:\r\n\r\n`dvd-vr VR_MANGR.IFO VR_MOVIE.VRO`\r\n\r\nWindows Binary: [udf_dump.zip](http://dose.0wnz.at/scripts/cpp/udf_dump.zip)\r\nFor Linux, just type make to compile each program.\r\n\r\n\r\n# MEIHDFS\r\n\r\nFor further information on how to use it and for technical details about the filesystem structure, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/leecher1337/panasonic-rec/blob/master/meihdfs/README.txt) file. \r\nFor the impatient ones, assuming you have a disk image image.dd and a recovery destination directory f:\\dump, just do:\r\n\r\n`extract_meihdfs image.dd f:\\dump`\r\n\r\nAfter successful extraction, you can do this to extract the programs:\r\n\r\n`for /r \"F:\\dump\\DVD_RTAV\\\" %I in (*.VRO) do dvd-vr -n [ts]-[label] \"%~dI%~pI%~nI.IFO\" \"%~I\"`\r\n\r\nWindows Binary: [meihdfs.zip](http://dose.0wnz.at/scripts/cpp/meihdfs.zip)\r\nFor Linux, just type make to compile each program.\r\n\r\n# Other Recorders\r\nFor Pioneer DVR recorders, you can have a look at my [pioneer-rec](https://github.com/leecher1337/pioneer-rec/) project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
